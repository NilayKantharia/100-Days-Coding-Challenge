**LeetCode : 834. Sum of Distances in Tree**

There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.

You are given the integer n and the array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Return an array answer of length n where answer[i] is the sum of the distances between the ith node in the tree and all other nodes.

 

Example 1:

![lc-sumdist1](https://github.com/NilayKantharia/100-Days-Coding-Challenge/assets/125391394/905dae53-3c69-4134-a6d0-869ec2ce15d3)

Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [8,12,6,10,10,10]
Explanation: The tree is shown above.
We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.
Hence, answer[0] = 8, and so on.

Input: n = 1, edges = []
Output: [0]

Input: n = 2, edges = [[1,0]]
Output: [1,1]
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 3 * 104
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < n
ai != bi
The given input represents a valid tree.

**GeeksForGeeks : Delete Middle of Linked List**

Given a singly linked list, delete middle of the linked list. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then linked list should be modified to 1->2->4->5.
If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to delete the second middle element. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then it should be modified to 1->2->3->5->6.
If the input linked list has single node, then it should return NULL.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 
1 2 4 5
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1
Output: 
2 4 6 5 1
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function deleteMid() which takes head of the linkedlist  and return head of the linkedlist with middle element deleted from the linked list. If the linked list is empty or contains single element then it should return NULL.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= value[i] <= 109
