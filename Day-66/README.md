**LeetCode : Largest Local Values in a Matrix**

You are given an n x n integer matrix grid.

Generate an integer matrix maxLocal of size (n - 2) x (n - 2) such that:

maxLocal[i][j] is equal to the largest value of the 3 x 3 matrix in grid centered around row i + 1 and column j + 1.
In other words, we want to find the largest value in every contiguous 3 x 3 matrix in grid.

Return the generated matrix.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[9,9,8,1],[5,6,2,6],[8,2,6,4],[6,2,2,2]]
Output: [[9,9],[8,6]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the original matrix and the generated matrix.
Notice that each value in the generated matrix corresponds to the largest value of a contiguous 3 x 3 matrix in grid.

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,2,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]
Explanation: Notice that the 2 is contained within every contiguous 3 x 3 matrix in grid.
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length == grid[i].length
3 <= n <= 100
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

**GeeksForGeeks : Minimum steps to destination**

Given an infinite number line. You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right. The condition is that in the ith move, you must take i steps. Given a destination d, find the minimum number of steps required to reach that destination.

Example 1:

Input: d = 2
Output: 3
Explaination: The steps takn are +1, -2 and +3.
Example 2:

Input: d = 10
Output: 4
Explaination: The steps are +1, +2, +3 and +4.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minSteps() which takes the value d as input parameter and returns the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination d from 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(d))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ d ≤ 10000
