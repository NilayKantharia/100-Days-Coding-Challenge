****LeetCode : 623. Add One Row to Tree****
Given the root of a binary tree and two integers val and depth, add a row of nodes with value val at the given depth depth.

Note that the root node is at depth 1.

The adding rule is:

Given the integer depth, for each not null tree node cur at the depth depth - 1, create two tree nodes with value val as cur's left subtree root and right subtree root.
cur's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root.
cur's original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root.
If depth == 1 that means there is no depth depth - 1 at all, then create a tree node with value val as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.
 

Example 1:

![addrow-tree](https://github.com/NilayKantharia/100-Days-Coding-Challenge/assets/125391394/6e9a2d66-1c96-49e2-962e-9214ee1eaece)

Input: root = [4,2,6,3,1,5], val = 1, depth = 2
Output: [4,1,1,2,null,null,6,3,1,5]
Example 2:
![add2-tree](https://github.com/NilayKantharia/100-Days-Coding-Challenge/assets/125391394/19223922-0f14-4962-b78f-7b56eed245a3)
Input: root = [4,2,null,3,1], val = 1, depth = 3
Output: [4,2,null,1,1,3,null,null,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
The depth of the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
-105 <= val <= 105
1 <= depth <= the depth of tree + 1

**GeeksForGeeks : Minimize the Difference**
You are given an array arr of size n. You have to remove a subarray of size k , such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the remaining array is minimized.
Find the minimum value obtained after performing the operation of the removal of the subarray and return it.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
k = 3
arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
We can remove first subarray of length 3(i.e. {1, 2, 3}) then remaining array will be {4,5} and the difference of maximum and minimum element will be 1 i.e 5 - 4 = 1
Example 2:

Input:
n = 6
k = 3
arr = {2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7}
Output: 
2
Explanation:
If we remove the subarray {2,3,1} then remaining array will be {4,6,7} and the difference  = 7-4 = 3
If we remove the subarray {3,1,4} then remaining array will be {2,6,7} and the difference  = 7-2 = 5
If we remove the subarray {1,4,6} then remaining array will be {2,3,7} and the difference  = 7-2 = 5
If we remove the subarray {4,6,7} then remaining array will be {2,3,1} and the difference  = 3-1 = 2
So the answer will be min(3,5,5,2) = 2
Your Task: 
You have to complete the function minimizeDifference( ), which takes two integers n and k and an integer array arr of size n. You have to return the minimum difference of maximum and minimum elements of the remaining array after removing one k length subarray of it.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 105
1 <= k <= n-1
0 <= arr[i] <= 109
