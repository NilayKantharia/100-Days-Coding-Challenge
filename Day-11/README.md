**452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons**
There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

 

Example 1:

Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
Example 3:

Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
 

Constraints:

1 <= points.length <= 105
points[i].length == 2
-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1

**977. Squares of a Sorted Array**
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 

Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?

********
**2864. Maximum Odd Binary Number**
You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.

You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "010"
Output: "001"
Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is "001".
Example 2:

Input: s = "0101"
Output: "1001"
Explanation: One of the '1's must be in the last position. The maximum number that can be made with the remaining digits is "100". So the answer is "1001".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of '0' and '1'.
s contains at least one '1'.

**Level order traversal**
Given a root of a binary tree with n nodes, find its level order traversal.
Level order traversal of a tree is breadth-first traversal for the tree.

Example 1:

Input:
    1
  /   \ 
 3     2
Output:
1 3 2
Example 2:

Input:
        10
     /      \
    20       30
  /   \
 40   60
Output:
10 20 30 40 60
Your Task:
You don't have to take any input. Complete the function levelOrder() that takes the root node as input parameter and returns a list of integers containing the level order traversal of the given Binary Tree.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
0 ≤ Data of a node ≤ 109
