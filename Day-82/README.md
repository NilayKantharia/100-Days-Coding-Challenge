**LeetCode : 1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget**

You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.

You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd".
That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
t.length == s.length
0 <= maxCost <= 106
s and t consist of only lowercase English letters.

**GeeksForGeeks : Minimum cost to fill given weight in a bag**

Given an array cost[] of positive integers of size n and an integer w, where cost[i] represents the cost of an i kg packet of oranges, the task is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly w kg of oranges. The cost array has a 1-based indexing. If buying exactly w kg of oranges is impossible, then return -1.
Note:
1. cost[i] = -1 means that i kg packet of orange is unavailable.
2. It may be assumed that there is an infinite supply of all available packet types.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5
cost[] = {20, 10, 4, 50, 100} 
w = 5
Output: 
14
Explanation: 
Purchase the 2kg packet for 10 coins and the 3kg packet for 4 coins to buy 5kg of oranges for 14 coins.
Example 2:

Input: 
n = 5
cost[] = {-1, -1, 4, 3, -1}
w = 5
Output: 
-1
Explanation: 
It is not possible to buy 5 kgs of oranges.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function minimumCost() which takes integers n and w, and integer array cost[] as input parameters and returns the minimum cost to buy exactly w kg of oranges, If buying exactly w kg of oranges is impossible, then return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*w)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*w)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n, w ≤ 2*102
1 ≤ cost[i] ≤ 105
cost[i] ≠ 0
