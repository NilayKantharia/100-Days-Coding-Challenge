Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

38. Count and Say
Solved

Hint
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.
To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string "3322251":


Given a positive integer n, return the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 30

**LeetCodeProblem2**
2. Add Two Numbers
Solved
Medium
Topics
Companies
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 

Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Solved
Easy
Topics
Companies
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

 

Example 1:


Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a string str which may contain lowercase and uppercase characters. The task is to remove all duplicate characters from the string and find the resultant string. The order of remaining characters in the output should be same as in the original string.

Example 1:

Input:
str = "geEksforGEeks"
Output: 
"geEksforG"
Explanation: 
After removing duplicate characters such as E, e, k, s, we have string as "geEksforG".
Example 2:

Input:
str = "HaPpyNewYear"
Output: 
"HaPpyNewYr"
Explanation: 
After removing duplicate characters such as e, a, we have string as "HaPpyNewYr".
Your Task:
Complete the function removeDuplicates() which takes a string str, as input parameters and returns a string denoting the answer. You don't have to print answer or take inputs.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
String contains uppercase and lowercase english letters.
