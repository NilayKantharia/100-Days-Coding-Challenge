****LeetCode : 200. Number of Islands****

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

****LeetCode : 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation****

You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
There will not be any division by zero.
The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.
 

Example 1:

Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
Example 2:

Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
Example 3:

Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
 

Constraints:

1 <= tokens.length <= 104
tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].

****LeetCode : 155. Min Stack****

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

 

Example 1:

Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
 

Constraints:

-231 <= val <= 231 - 1
Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin.

**GeeksForGeeks : Find missing in second array**
Given two integer arrays a of size n and b of size m, the task is to find the numbers which are present in the first array a, but not present in the second array b.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 6, m = 5
a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10}
b[] = {2, 3, 1, 0, 5}
Output: 
4 10
Explanation: 
4 and 10 are present in first array, but not in second array.
Example 2:

Input: 
n = 5, m = 5
a[] = {4, 3, 5, 9, 11}
b[] = {4, 9, 3, 11, 10}
Output: 
5  
Explanation: 
Second array does not contain element 5.
Your Task:
You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function findMissing() that takes an integer array a, an integer array b, an integer n, and an integer m as input parameters and returns an array that contains the missing elements and the order of the elements should be the same as they are in array a.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n+m).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(m).

Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105
-109 ≤ A[i], B[i] ≤ 109
