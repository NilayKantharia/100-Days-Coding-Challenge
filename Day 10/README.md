**LeetCode**
**57. Insert Interval**
You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return intervals after the insertion.

Note that you don't need to modify intervals in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

 

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
 

Constraints:

0 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 105
intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
newInterval.length == 2
0 <= start <= end <= 105

**12. Integer to Roman**
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
Example 2:

Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 3999

**94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal**
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
 

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

********
**14. Longest Common Prefix**
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

**Count Pairs whose sum is equal to X**
Given two linked list head1 and head2 with distinct elements, determine the count of all distinct pairs from both lists whose sum is equal to the given value x.

Note: A valid pair would be in the form (x, y) where x is from first linked list and y is from second linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
head1 = 1->2->3->4->5->6
head2 = 11->12->13
x = 15
Output: 3
Explanation: There are total 3 pairs whose sum is 15 : (4,11) , (3,12) and (2,13)
Example 2:

Input:
head1 = 7->5->1->3
head2 = 3->5->2->8
x = 10
Output: 2
Explanation: There are total 2 pairs whose sum is 10 : (7,3) and (5,5)
Your Task:
You only need to implement the given function countPairs() that take two linked list head1 and head2 and return the count of distinct pairs whose sum is equal to x.

Expected Time Complexity: O(length(head1)+lenght(head2)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(length(head1)) or O(length(head2)).

Constraints:
1<=length(head1), lenght(head2)<=105
1 <= Value of elements of  linked lists <= 109
1<= x <= 109
Note : All elements in each linked list are unique.
