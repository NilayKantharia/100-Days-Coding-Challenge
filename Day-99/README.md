### LeetCode: 945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique


You are given an integer array nums. In one move, you can pick an index i where 0 <= i < nums.length and increment nums[i] by 1.

Return the minimum number of moves to make every value in nums unique.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Output: 6
Explanation: After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

### GeeksforGeeks: Armstrong Numbers


You are given a 3-digit number n, Find whether it is an Armstrong number or not.

An Armstrong number of three digits is a number such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. 371 is an Armstrong number since 33 + 73 + 13 = 371. 

Note: Return "true" if it is an Armstrong number else return "false".

Examples

Input: n = 153
Output: true
Explanation: 153 is an Armstrong number since 13 + 53 + 33 = 153. Hence answer is "true".
Input: n = 372
Output: false
Explanation: 372 is not an Armstrong number since 33 + 73 + 23 = 378. Hence answer is "false".
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) 

Constraints:
100 â‰¤ n <1000
