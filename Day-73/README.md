**LeetCode : 3068. Find the Maximum Sum of Node Values**

There exists an undirected tree with n nodes numbered 0 to n - 1. You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi in the tree. You are also given a positive integer k, and a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers nums of length n, where nums[i] represents the value of the node numbered i.

Alice wants the sum of values of tree nodes to be maximum, for which Alice can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero) on the tree:

Choose any edge [u, v] connecting the nodes u and v, and update their values as follows:
nums[u] = nums[u] XOR k
nums[v] = nums[v] XOR k
Return the maximum possible sum of the values Alice can achieve by performing the operation any number of times.

Input: nums = [1,2,1], k = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Alice can achieve the maximum sum of 6 using a single operation:
- Choose the edge [0,2]. nums[0] and nums[2] become: 1 XOR 3 = 2, and the array nums becomes: [1,2,1] -> [2,2,2].
The total sum of values is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
It can be shown that 6 is the maximum achievable sum of values.

Input: nums = [2,3], k = 7, edges = [[0,1]]
Output: 9
Explanation: Alice can achieve the maximum sum of 9 using a single operation:
- Choose the edge [0,1]. nums[0] becomes: 2 XOR 7 = 5 and nums[1] become: 3 XOR 7 = 4, and the array nums becomes: [2,3] -> [5,4].
The total sum of values is 5 + 4 = 9.
It can be shown that 9 is the maximum achievable sum of values.

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7], k = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5]]
Output: 42
Explanation: The maximum achievable sum is 42 which can be achieved by Alice performing no operations.
 

Constraints:

2 <= n == nums.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= k <= 109
0 <= nums[i] <= 109
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1
The input is generated such that edges represent a valid tree.

**GeeksForGeeks : Find the closest number**

Given a sorted array arr[] of positive integers. The task is to find the closest value in the array to the given number k. The array may contain duplicate values.

Note: If the difference with k is the same for two values in the array return the greater value.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 4
k = 4
arr[] = {1, 3, 6, 7}
Output: 
3
Explanation:
We have array arr={1, 3, 6, 7} and target is 4. If we look at the absolute difference of target with every element of the array we will get { |1-4|, |3-4|, |6-4|, |7-4| }  = {3, 1, 2, 3}. So, the closest number is 3.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 7
k = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Output:
5
Explanation:
The absolute difference of 4 is 1 from both 3 and 5. According to the question, we have to return greater value, which is 5.
Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function findClosest() that takes integers n and k and sorted array arr[] of size n as input parameters and return the closest number in the array to k. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(n)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
1 ≤ k ≤ 109
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
