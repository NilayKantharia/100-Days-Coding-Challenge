**1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists**
You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.

Remove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.

The blue edges and nodes in the following figure indicate the result:


Build the result list and return its head.

 

Example 1:


Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
Output: [10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
Example 2:


Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]
Output: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]
Explanation: The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
 

Constraints:

3 <= list1.length <= 104
1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1
1 <= list2.length <= 104

**Sum of nodes on the longest path from root to leaf node**
Given a binary tree having n nodes. Find the sum of all nodes on the longest path from root to any leaf node. If two or more paths compete for the longest path, then the path having maximum sum of nodes will be considered.

Example 1:

Input: 
        4        
       /  \       
      2   5      
     / \   /  \     
    7  1 2  3    
      /
     6
Output: 
13
Explanation:
        4        
       /  \       
      2   5      
     / \   /  \     
    7  1 2  3 
      /
     6
The highlighted nodes (4, 2, 1, 6) above are part of the longest root to leaf path having sum = (4 + 2 + 1 + 6) = 13
Example 2:

Input: 
          1
        /   \
       2    3
      / \    /  \
     4   5 6   7
Output: 
11
Explanation:
Use path 1->3->7, with sum 11.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sumOfLongRootToLeafPath() which takes root node of the tree as input parameter and returns an integer denoting the sum of the longest root to leaf path of the tree.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
0 <= data of each node <= 104
