### Leetcode: 846. Hand of Straights

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and consists of groupSize consecutive cards.

Given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the ith card and an integer groupSize, return true if she can rearrange the cards, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]
Example 2:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.

 

Constraints:

1 <= hand.length <= 104
0 <= hand[i] <= 109
1 <= groupSize <= hand.length

### GeeksForGeeks: Max sum in the configuration

Given an integer array(0-based indexing) a of size n. Your task is to return the maximum value of the sum of i*a[i] for all 0<= i <=n-1, where a[i] is the element at index i in the array. The only operation allowed is to rotate(clockwise or counterclockwise) the array any number of times.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, a[] = {8, 3, 1, 2}
Output: 29
Explanation: All the configurations possible by rotating the elements are:
3 1 2 8 here sum is 3*0+1*1+2*2+8*3 = 29
1 2 8 3 here sum is 1*0+2*1+8*2+3*3 = 27
2 8 3 1 here sum is 2*0+8*1+3*2+1*3 = 17
8 3 1 2 here sum is 8*0+3*1+1*2+2*3 = 11, so the maximum sum will be 29.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, a[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 8
Explanation: All the configurations possible by rotating the elements are:
1 2 3 here sum is 1*0+2*1+3*2 = 8
3 1 2 here sum is 3*0+1*1+2*2 = 5
2 3 1 here sum is 2*0+3*1+1*2 = 5, so the maximum sum will be 8.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1<=n<=105
1<=a[]<=106
