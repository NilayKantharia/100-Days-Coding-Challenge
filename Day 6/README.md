2485. Find the Pivot Integer
Solved
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
Given a positive integer n, find the pivot integer x such that:

The sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively.
Return the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, return -1. It is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot index for the given input.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: 6 is the pivot integer since: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 + 7 + 8 = 21.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the pivot integer since: 1 = 1.
Example 3:

Input: n = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be proved that no such integer exist.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000

Hint
Given a string s, return the longest 
palindromic
 
substring
 in s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consist of only digits and English letters.

6. Zigzag Conversion
Solved

Topics
Companies
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Example 2:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
Example 3:

Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.
1 <= numRows <= 1000

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

 

Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
 

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104

Given a square matrix mat[][] of n*n size, the task is to determine the diagonal pattern which is a linear arrangement of the elements of the matrix as depicted in the following example:



Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
mat[][] = {{1, 2, 3},
           {4, 5, 6},
           {7, 8, 9}}
Output: {1, 2, 4, 7, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9}
Explaination:
Starting from (0, 0): 1,
Move to the right to (0, 1): 2,
Move diagonally down to (1, 0): 4,
Move diagonally down to (2, 0): 7,
Move diagonally up to (1, 1): 5,
Move diagonally up to (0, 2): 3,
Move to the right to (1, 2): 6,
Move diagonally up to (2, 1): 8,
Move diagonally up to (2, 2): 9
There for the output is {1, 2, 4, 7, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9}.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 2
mat[][] = {{1, 2},
           {3, 4}}
Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Explaination:
Starting from (0, 0): 1,
Move to the right to (0, 1): 2,
Move diagonally down to (1, 0): 3,
Move to the right to (1, 1): 4
There for the output is {1, 2, 3, 4}.
Your Task:
You only need to implement the given function matrixDiagonally() which takes a matrix mat[][] of size n*n as an input and returns a list of integers containing the matrix diagonally. Do not read input, instead use the arguments given in the function.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
-100 <= elements of matrix <= 100
