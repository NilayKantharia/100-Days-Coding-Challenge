**1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch**
The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.

The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:

If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.
This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.

You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i​​​​​​th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of the j​​​​​​th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). Return the number of students that are unable to eat.

 

Example 1:

Input: students = [1,1,0,0], sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
Output: 0 
Explanation:
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,0,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,0,1,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [0,1,1] and sandwiches = [1,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,1,0].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1,0] and sandwiches = [0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1] and sandwiches = [1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [] and sandwiches = [].
Hence all students are able to eat.
Example 2:

Input: students = [1,1,1,0,0,1], sandwiches = [1,0,0,0,1,1]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= students.length, sandwiches.length <= 100
students.length == sandwiches.length
sandwiches[i] is 0 or 1.
students[i] is 0 or 1.

**Optimal Strategy For A Game**

You are given an array arr of size n. The elements of the array represent n coin of values v1, v2, ....vn. You play against an opponent in an alternating way. In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin from the row, removes it from the row permanently, and receives the value of the coin.
You need to determine the maximum possible amount of money you can win if you go first.
Note: Both the players are playing optimally.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {5, 3, 7, 10}
Output: 
15
Explanation: The user collects maximum
value as 15(10 + 5). It is guarantee that we cannot get more than 15 by any possible moves.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {8, 15, 3, 7}
Output: 
22
Explanation: The user collects maximum
value as 22(7 + 15). It is guarantee that we cannot get more than 22 by any possible moves.
Your Task:
Complete the function maximumAmount() which takes an array arr[] (represent values of n coins) and n as a number of coins as a parameter and returns the maximum possible amount of money you can win if you go first.

Expected Time Complexity : O(n*n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*n)

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 103
1 <= arr[i] <= 106
