****LeetCode : 42. Trapping Rain Water****
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105

**GeeksForGeeks : Sum of Products**
Given an array arr[] of size n. Calculate the sum of Bitwise ANDs ie: calculate sum of arr[i] & arr[j] for all the pairs in the given array arr[] where i < j.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
arr = {5, 10, 15}
Output:
15
Explanation:
The bitwise Ands of all pairs where i<j are (5&10) = 0, (5&15) = 5 and (10&15) = 10.
Therefore, the total sum = (0+5+10) = 15.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr = {10, 20, 30, 40}
Output:
46
Explanation:
The sum of bitwise Ands 
of all pairs = (0+10+8+20+0+8) = 46.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your Task is to complete the function pairAndSum() which takes an Integer n and an array arr[]  of size n as input parameters and returns the sum of bitwise Ands of all pairs.

Expected Time Complexity:O(n)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 108
