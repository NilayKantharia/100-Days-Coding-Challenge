****LeetCode : 752. Open the Lock****

You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

 

Example 1:

Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".
Example 2:

Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".
Example 3:

Input: deadends = ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"], target = "8888"
Output: -1
Explanation: We cannot reach the target without getting stuck.
 

Constraints:

1 <= deadends.length <= 500
deadends[i].length == 4
target.length == 4
target will not be in the list deadends.
target and deadends[i] consist of digits only.

**GeeksForGeeks : Row with minimum number of 1's**

Given a 2D binary matrix(1-based indexed) a of dimensions nxm , determine the row that contains the minimum number of 1's.
Note: The matrix contains only 1's and 0's. Also, if two or more rows contain the minimum number of 1's, the answer is the lowest of those indices.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4,m = 4
a = [[1, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 0, 0], 
     [0, 0, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 1, 1]]
Output:
2
Explanation:
Rows 2 and 3 contain the minimum number 
of 1's(2 each).Since,row 2 is less than row 3.
Thus, the answer is 2.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 3,m = 3
a = [[0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]]
Output:
1
Explanation:
All the rows contain the same number 
of 1's(0 each).Among them, index 1 
is the smallest, so the answer is 1.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minRow() which takes the two integers n, m as well as the 2D binary matrix a as input parameters and returns the minimum index of the row which contains the least number of 1's.

Expected Time Complexity:O(n*m)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n,m <= 1000

0 <= a[i][j] <= 1
