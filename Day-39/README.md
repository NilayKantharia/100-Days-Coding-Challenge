****LeetCode : 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers****
You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:
![num1tree](https://github.com/NilayKantharia/100-Days-Coding-Challenge/assets/125391394/aa9e1af1-73e3-4e3b-b8fb-69b29c9ee388)

Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.


Example 2:


Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
The depth of the tree will not exceed 10.

**GeeksForGeeks : Count the elements**
Given two arrays a and b both of size n. Given q queries in an array query each having a positive integer x denoting an index of the array a. For each query, your task is to find all the elements less than or equal to a[x] in the array b.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
a[] = {4,1,2}
b[] = {1,7,3}
q = 2
query[] = {0,1}
Output : 
2
1
Explanation: 
For 1st query, the given index is 0, a[0] = 4. There are 2 elements(1 and 3) which are less than or equal to 4.
For 2nd query, the given index is 1, a[1] = 1. There exists only 1 element(1) which is less than or equal to 1.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
a[] = {1,1,5,5}
b[] = {0,1,2,3}
q = 4
query[] = {0,1,2,3}
Output : 
2
2
4
4
Explanation: 
For 1st query and 2nd query, the given index is 0 and 1 respectively, a[0] = a[1] = 1. There are 2 elements(0 and 1) which are less than or equal to 1. 
For 3rd query and 4th query, the given index is 2 and 3 respectively, a[2] = a[3] = 5. All the 4 elements are less than or equal to 5.   
Your Task:
You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function countElements() that takes array a and b of size n, and array query of size q as parameters and returns an array that contains the answer to the corresponding queries. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n+q+maximum of a and b).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(maximum of a and b).

Constraints:
1 ≤ q ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 105
0 ≤ query[i] < n
