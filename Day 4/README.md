791. Custom Sort String
Solved
Medium
Topics
Companies
You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.

 

Example 1:

Input:  order = "cba", s = "abcd" 

Output:  "cbad" 

Explanation: "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".

Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.

Example 2:

Input:  order = "bcafg", s = "abcd" 

Output:  "bcad" 

Explanation: The characters "b", "c", and "a" from order dictate the order for the characters in s. The character "d" in s does not appear in order, so its position is flexible.

Following the order of appearance in order, "b", "c", and "a" from s should be arranged as "b", "c", "a". "d" can be placed at any position since it's not in order. The output "bcad" correctly follows this rule. Other arrangements like "bacd" or "bcda" would also be valid, as long as "b", "c", "a" maintain their order.

 

Constraints:

1 <= order.length <= 26
1 <= s.length <= 200
order and s consist of lowercase English letters.
All the characters of order are unique.

28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
Solved
Easy
Topics
Companies
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

977. Squares of a Sorted Array
Solved
Easy
Topics
Companies
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 

Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?

175. Combine Two Tables
Solved
Easy
Topics
Companies
SQL Schema
Pandas Schema
Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
 

Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
 

Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----------+----------+-----------+
| personId | lastName | firstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
+----------+----------+-----------+
Address table:
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
Explanation: 
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.

Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

Example 2:

Input:

196. Delete Duplicate Emails
Solved
Easy
Topics

SQL Schema
Pandas Schema
Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

Given two sorted matrices mat1 and mat2 of size n x n of elements. Each matrix contains numbers arranged in strictly ascending order, with each row sorted from left to right, and the last element of a row being smaller than the first element of the next row. You're given a target value, x, your task is to find and count all pairs {a, b} such that a is from mat1 and b is from mat2 where sum of a and b is equal to x.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 3, x = 21
mat1 = {{1, 5, 6},
        {8, 10, 11},
        {15, 16, 18}}
mat2 = {{2, 4, 7},
        {9, 10, 12},
        {13, 16, 20}}
OUTPUT: 4
Explanation: The pairs whose sum is found to be 21 are (1, 20), (5, 16), (8, 13), (11, 10).
Example 2:

Input:
n = 2, x = 10
mat1 = {{1, 2},
        {3, 4}}
mat2 = {{4, 5},
        {6, 7}}
Output: 2
Explanation: The pairs whose sum found to be 10 are (4, 6), (3, 7).
User Task:
Your task is to complete the function countPairs() which takes 4 arguments mat1, mat2, n, x, and returns the count of pairs whose sum equals to x. You don't need to take any input or print anything.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n2).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ mat1[i][j] , mat2[i][j] ≤ 105
1 ≤ n ≤ 100
1 ≤ x ≤ 105
