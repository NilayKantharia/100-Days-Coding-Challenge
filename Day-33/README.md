**2073. Time Needed to Buy Tickets**
There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person is at the front of the line and the (n - 1)th person is at the back of the line.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n where the number of tickets that the ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].

Each person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.

Return the time taken for the person at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.

 

Example 1:

Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [1, 2, 1].
- In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [0, 1, 0].
The person at position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.
Example 2:

Input: tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0
Output: 8
Explanation:
- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [4, 0, 0, 0].
- In the next 4 passes, only the person in position 0 is buying tickets.
The person at position 0 has successfully bought 5 tickets and it took 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 seconds.
 

Constraints:

n == tickets.length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= tickets[i] <= 100
0 <= k < n

**62. Unique Paths**
There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

 

Example 1:


Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
 

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 100

**Minimum Points To Reach Destination**

Given a m*n grid with each cell consisting of positive, negative, or zero point. We can move across a cell only if we have positive points. Whenever we pass through a cell, points in that cell are added to our overall points, the task is to find minimum initial points to reach cell (m-1, n-1) from (0, 0) by following these certain set of rules :
1. From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1).
2. We cannot move from (i, j) if your overall points at (i, j) are <= 0.
3. We have to reach at (n-1, m-1) with minimum positive points i.e., > 0.

Example 1:

Input: 
m = 3, n = 3 
points = {{-2,-3,3}, 
          {-5,-10,1},
          {10,30,-5}} 
Output: 
7 
Explanation: 7 is the minimum value to reach the destination with positive throughout the path. Below is the path. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) We start from (0, 0) with 7, we reach (0, 1) with 5, (0, 2) with 2, (1, 2) with 5, (2, 2) with and finally we have 1 point (we needed greater than 0 points at the end).
Example 2:
Input:
m = 3, n = 2
points = {{2,3},  
          {5,10},  
          {10,30}} 
Output: 
1 
Explanation: Take any path, all of them are positive. So, required one point at the start
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function minPoints() which takes m,n and 2-d vector points as input parameters and returns the minimum initial points to reach cell (m-1, n-1) from (0, 0).

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*m)

Constraints:
1 ≤ m ≤ 103  
1 ≤ n ≤ 103
-103 ≤ points[i][j] ≤ 103
