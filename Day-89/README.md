### Leetcode : 409. Longest Palindrome

Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest 
palindrome
 that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2000
s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.

### GeeksForGeeks : Binary representation of next number

Given a binary representation in the form of a string(s) of a number n, the task is to find a binary representation of n+1.

Note: Output binary string should not contain leading zeros.

Example 1:

Input: s = "10"
Output: 11
Explanation: "10" is the binary representation of 2 and binary representation of 3 is "11"
Example 2:

Input: s = "111"
Output: 1000
Explanation: "111" is the binary representation of 7 and binary representation of 8 is "1000"
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function binaryNextNumber()which takes s as input parameter and returns the string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n) to store resultant string  

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
