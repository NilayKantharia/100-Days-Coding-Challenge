## 100/100 Days Completed of 100-Days-Coding-Challenge

Reflecting on this 100-day challenge, the progress has been extraordinary. From the first day's struggle to today's achievements, this challenge has reshaped my approach to learning, problem-solving, and consistency. 
As I wrap up this 100-day journey, I'm grateful for the growth and knowledge gained. This milestone is just the beginning, and I'm excited to continue my exploration and advancement in coding and programming.


### LeetCode : 502. IPO

Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.

You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.

Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
Output: 6
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 105
0 <= w <= 109
n == profits.length
n == capital.length
1 <= n <= 105
0 <= profits[i] <= 104
0 <= capital[i] <= 109

### GeeksforGeeks: Mobile numeric keypad

There is a standard numeric keypad on a mobile phone. You can only press the current button or buttons that are directly up, left, right, or down from it (for ex if you press 5, then pressing 2, 4, 6 & 8 are allowed). Diagonal movements and pressing the bottom row corner buttons (* and #) are prohibited.

Given a number n, find the number of possible unique sequences of length n that you can create by pressing buttons. You can start from any digit.

Examples

Input: n = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: Number of possible numbers are 10 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)  
Input: n = 2
Output: 36
Explanation: Possible numbers: 00, 08, 11, 12, 14, 22, 21, 23, 25 and so on. If we start with 0, valid numbers will be 00, 08 (count: 2). If we start with 1, valid numbers will be 11, 12, 14 (count: 3). If we start with 2, valid numbers  will be 22, 21, 23,25 (count: 4). If we start with 3, valid numbers will be 33, 32, 36 (count: 3). If we start with 4, valid numbers will be 44,41,45,47 (count: 4). If we start with 5, valid numbers will be 55,54,52,56,58 (count: 5) and so on.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 25
