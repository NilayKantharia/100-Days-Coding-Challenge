**287. Find the Duplicate Number**
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
 

Follow up:

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

**Insert an Element at the Bottom of a Stack**
You are given a stack st of n integers and an element x. You have to insert x at the bottom of the given stack. 

Note: Everywhere in this problem, the bottommost element of the stack is shown first while priniting the stack.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
x = 2
st = {4,3,2,1,8}
Output:
{2,4,3,2,1,8}
Explanation:
After insertion of 2, the final stack will be {2,4,3,2,1,8}.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 3
x = 4
st = {5,3,1}
Output:
{4,5,3,1}
Explanation:
After insertion of 4, the final stack will be {4,5,3,1}.
Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function insertAtBottom() which takes a stack st and an integer x as inputs and returns the modified stack after insertion.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
0 <= x, elements of stack <= 109
