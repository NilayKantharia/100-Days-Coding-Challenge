**LeetCode : 2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List**

You are given the head of a non-empty linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.

Return the head of the linked list after doubling it.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,8,9]
Output: [3,7,8]
Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.
Example 2:


Input: head = [9,9,9]
Output: [1,9,9,8]
Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 999. Hence, the returned linked list reprersents the number 999 * 2 = 1998. 
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 104]
0 <= Node.val <= 9
The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number 0 itself.

**GeeksForGeeks : Reverse Level Order Traversal**

Given a binary tree of size n, find its reverse level order traversal. ie- the traversal must begin from the last level.

Example 1:

Input :
        1
      /   \
     3     2

Output: 
3 2 1
Explanation:
Traversing level 1 : 3 2
Traversing level 0 : 1
Example 2:

Input :
       10
      /  \
     20   30
    / \ 
   40  60

Output: 
40 60 20 30 10
Explanation:
Traversing level 2 : 40 60
Traversing level 1 : 20 30
Traversing level 0 : 10
Your Task: 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function reverseLevelOrder() which takes the root of the tree as input parameter and returns a list containing the reverse level order traversal of the given tree.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 104
